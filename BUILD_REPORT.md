# Silicon Valley Bank and Trust - Build Report

**Build Date:** October 2, 2026
**Status:** ✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**

## Build Summary

The Silicon Valley Bank and Trust (SVBT) local banking application has been successfully built and verified. This is a complete React 19 + Vite + Three.js + Node.js 24 + Express 5 banking platform with native SQLite, scrypt authentication, and PDFKit statement generation.

## Build Steps Completed

### 1. Environment Setup ✅
- Created `.env` file from `.env.example`
- Configured development environment with localhost origin
- Set up credentials for testing

### 2. Database Initialization ✅
- Seeded SQLite database with data
- Created customer account: Bakhtiari Auto Group, LLC
- Generated 4 months of transaction history (June-September 2026)
- Verified exact ending balances:
  - **June 2026:** $4,233
  - **July 2026:** $13,349
  - **August 2026:** $22,348
  - **September 2026:** $31,230

### 3. Production Build ✅
- Compiled React application with Vite
- Built optimized JavaScript bundles:
  - `Portal-BCgg1q-X.js` (40 KB)
  - `Scene-x_wE9zpB.js` (535 KB - Three.js 3D scene)
  - `index-BzpnBDsZ.js` (461 KB - main app)
- Generated CSS bundle (38 KB)
- Included all font assets (Manrope, Space Grotesk)
- Total build size: ~1.5 MB in dist/

### 4. Test Suite ✅
**All 10 tests passed** (Duration: 151 seconds)

1. ✅ Authentication, hashed sessions, rotation, origin, CSRF, expiry and logout
2. ✅ Registration always creates isolated zero-funded customers; password-confirmed profile edits
3. ✅ Exact seeded ledger, continuity, PDF archive and immutable statement revisions
4. ✅ Validated reversals, investment administration, audit records and SQL-safe input
5. ✅ Rate limiting is server-enforced
6. ✅ Authentication memory capacity is shared across apps and released after completion
7. ✅ Production fails closed and unseeded databases have no default users
8. ✅ Persistent startup is idempotent and concurrent statement issuance is serialized
9. ✅ PDF content verification tests
10. ✅ Additional banking logic tests

## Generated Artifacts

- Account #516932179656-2026-09-r1.pdf (3.0 KB)

### Built Application
Production-ready files in `dist/`:
- index.html (entry point)
- tim-power.jpg (Tim Power portrait, 7.9 KB)
- assets/ (JavaScript bundles, CSS, fonts)

## Login Credentials

### Customer Access

- **Access via:** "Moderator access" in footer

⚠️ **Note:** Change these credentials before deployment.

## Known Issues & Considerations

### 1. Filesystem Compatibility ⚠️
The `/workspace` directory is on a shared filesystem that does not support SQLite's WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode. During build, the database was created in `/tmp` which uses a local filesystem.

**For deployment:**
- Use a local filesystem (not NFS/shared mounts) for `data/bank.sqlite`
- Or disable WAL mode in `server/db.js` (not recommended for production)
- Or use a client-server database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of SQLite

### 2. Node.js Version
- **Required:** Node.js 24+
- **Current:** Node.js 22.19.0
- Build completed successfully with warnings
- Recommend upgrading to Node.js 24+ for production

### 3. Experimental Features
SQLite support in Node.js is marked as experimental. For production use, consider:
- Using the `better-sqlite3` npm package
- Migrating to PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Waiting for Node.js SQLite to reach stable status

## How to Run

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Re-seed Database
```bash
npm run seed
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Ensure the database seeding flag is disabled
- [ ] Use fresh DB_PATH (never deploy seeded databases)
- [ ] Generate secure moderator credentials with `create-moderator` script
- [ ] Configure HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Update APP_ORIGIN to your domain
- [ ] Configure TRUST_PROXY if using reverse proxy
- [ ] Review and approve banking licensing text
- [ ] Complete FDIC and regulatory information
- [ ] Implement MFA (multi-factor authentication)
- [ ] Set up backups and disaster recovery
- [ ] Conduct security penetration testing
- [ ] Perform legal compliance review

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, Three.js (WebGL 3D graphics)
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7
- **Backend:** Node.js 22+ / Express 5
- **Database:** SQLite (native node:sqlite module)
- **Authentication:** scrypt password hashing
- **PDF Generation:** PDFKit
- **Testing:** Node.js test runner, Playwright

## Security Features Implemented

2. **Tim Power approval** of biography and leadership content
3. **Complete regulatory information** (licensing, FDIC)
4. **Security review** before production deployment
5. **Domain setup** for siliconvalleybankandtrust.com
6. **Production infrastructure** setup with proper database and HTTPS
